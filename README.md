## Calculate Average Rating for Each Restaurant

This project involves calculating the average rating for each restaurant and analyzing the distribution of ratings. The notebook includes data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization of rating distributions to provide insights into restaurant performance.

## Contents

1. **Introduction**
   - An overview of the objectives and goals of the project.
   - Explanation of the importance of analyzing restaurant ratings.

2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Loading the dataset containing restaurant ratings.
   - Cleaning the data to handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect entries.
   - Preparing the data for analysis by converting data types and normalizing text fields.

3. **Calculating Average Ratings**
   - Grouping the data by restaurant to calculate the average rating for each.
   - Handling edge cases where restaurants have very few ratings or outliers that may skew the average.

4. **Distribution of Ratings**
   - Analyzing the distribution of ratings across all restaurants.
   - Creating visualizations such as histograms and box plots to illustrate the spread and central tendency of the ratings.
   - Identifying patterns and trends in the rating data.

5. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Performing statistical tests to compare the ratings of different subsets of restaurants.
   - Analyzing correlations between restaurant features (e.g., location, cuisine type) and their ratings.
   - Discussing the significance and implications of the findings.

6. **Visualization**
   - Using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations.
   - Displaying the average ratings and distributions in a clear and understandable manner.
   - Highlighting key insights through graphs and charts.

7. **Conclusion**
   - Summarizing the main findings of the analysis.
   - Discussing the potential impact of the results on restaurant owners and customers.
   - Suggesting areas for further research and analysis.

## Analysis Performed

- **Average Rating Calculation:** The notebook calculates the average rating for each restaurant by aggregating individual ratings. This helps in identifying the overall performance of each restaurant.
  
- **Rating Distribution Analysis:** By examining the distribution of ratings, the analysis reveals common patterns such as the most frequent ratings, variability among restaurants, and potential outliers.
  
- **Statistical Tests:** Various statistical tests are conducted to determine if there are significant differences in ratings based on factors like cuisine type or location. This helps in understanding if certain types of restaurants tend to receive higher or lower ratings.
  
- **Visualization:** The use of visual tools aids in presenting complex data in an accessible way, making it easier to identify trends and insights at a glance.
